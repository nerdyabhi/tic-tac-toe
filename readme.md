2. Better Dark Mode Theme

### Version 2.0 Updates:
1. Implemented a bot to play against user.
2. No more annoying popup for changing Name.
3. More Clean and Optimized Code.

4. New GIF's for Winscreen Etc.

### Some Hidden Features :
- You can press `space` or `d` to toggle (on/off) dark mode.
- You can click on `Player's Turn ` button to change their names as well
- You can use a particular pattern to win every time (as i haven't used minimax algorithm).



### Left for future:

- [ ] User have their game data (including level of player) saved and can be acessed by logining.
